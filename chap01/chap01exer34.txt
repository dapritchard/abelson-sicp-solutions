*Exercise 1.34:* Suppose we define the procedure

     (define (f g)
       (g 2))

Then we have

     (f square)
     4

     (f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
     6

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination
`(f f)`?  Explain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We call `(f f)` which results in a call of `(f 2)`, which in turn then results
in a call of `(2 2)`, which throws an error since 2 is not a callable function.
